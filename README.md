OUDHitsquadManager
==================

Android App for the Official Unloved Device HitSquad

Currently WIP. 

The app downloads a file from my server, devices.txt
then it checks to see if that device's "ro.product.board" is in that devices.txt file and downloads a md5.txt file which will 
have md5sums of things like recovery images.
